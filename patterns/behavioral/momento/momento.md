# Momento Pattern

The **Memento pattern** is a behavioral design pattern used in software engineering to capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation. It provides a way to:

- Capture an object's internal state at a specific moment.
- Externalize the captured state so that it can be restored later.
- Maintain encapsulation while still allowing state-saving and restoration.

### Problem Solved:

The Memento pattern addresses the problem of needing to save and restore an object's state while keeping its encapsulation intact. It prevents the exposure of internal details that could violate encapsulation and lead to maintenance challenges and bugs.

### Use Cases

Here are some examples of where the Memento pattern can be applied:

1. **Text Editors with Undo/Redo:** Text editors use the Memento pattern to enable undo and redo functionality. Snapshots of the editor's state are saved after each change, allowing for easy restoration of previous states.

2. **Drawing and Graphic Editors:** Graphic editors employ the Memento pattern for undo and redo of actions like shape manipulation. Each action is represented as a memento, simplifying state restoration.

3. **Game State Management:** Video games use the Memento pattern to save and restore game states, enabling features like saving progress, checkpoints, and loading previous states.

4. **Workflow Management:** Applications with complex workflows use the Memento pattern to capture different stages of the workflow. This ensures consistency and facilitates managing user interactions.

5. **Configuration Management:** Software applications with changing configurations use the Memento pattern to save and revert configurations. This aids in maintaining different application states.

### Advantages

1. **State Management:** The pattern provides an organized way to manage an object's state history, enabling undo/redo functionality and historical state tracking.

2. **Encapsulation:** It promotes encapsulation by keeping the object's internal state hidden from external components while still allowing state restoration.

3. **Flexibility:** The pattern allows you to save and restore an object's state at various points in time, giving you the flexibility to implement features like undo, redo, and even time-travel debugging.

4. **Maintainability:** By encapsulating state-saving and restoration logic, the pattern makes the codebase more maintainable and readable, reducing potential bugs and improving debugging.

5. **Separation of Concerns:** The pattern separates the responsibility of maintaining object states from the core functionality of the object, leading to better code organization and modular design.

### Disadvantages

1. **Memory Usage:** Saving multiple snapshots of an object's state can consume memory, especially if the object's state is complex. This can impact the application's memory usage.

2. **Performance Overhead:** The process of saving and restoring states might introduce some performance overhead, especially for objects with large states.

3. **Complexity:** Implementing the Memento pattern might introduce additional classes and logic, which can increase the complexity of the codebase.

4. **Versioning Issues:** If the objects being managed by the Memento pattern undergo significant changes in their structure over time, restoring states might become challenging due to versioning mismatches.

5. **Limited Use Cases:** The Memento pattern is most beneficial for objects that require undo/redo functionality or state tracking. It might not be suitable for all types of applications or scenarios.

6. **Managing Object References:** In some cases, the Memento pattern might lead to issues with managing references, especially if the saved states contain references to other objects.

It's important to consider the specific needs of your application and the trade-offs involved before deciding to use the Memento pattern. While it's a powerful pattern for managing state history, it might not be the best fit for every situation.
In summary, the Memento pattern offers a solution for managing an object's historical states without exposing internal details. This promotes cleaner and more maintainable designs.
