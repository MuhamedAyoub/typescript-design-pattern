## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- Three main directories: `Creational`, `Structural`, and `Behavioral`.
- Each pattern has its own directory within the appropriate category.
- Inside each pattern directory, you'll find:
  - TypeScript code examples.
  - UML diagrams illustrating the pattern's structure.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the category and pattern you're interested in (e.g., `Creational/Factory`).
3. Explore the code examples to see the pattern in action.
4. Refer to the UML diagrams for a visual representation of the pattern's structure.
